'''
For every Scheduled Subject we have to add single teacher
    We get this teacher from subject.teachers.
We have to choose a day and hour when it begins
How_long will be calculated from lecture_hours/laboratory
We will have to put as parameter, date for first day of teaching
We also have to choose rooms, I know how to do it, but I am so scary about it
